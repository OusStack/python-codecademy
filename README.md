## Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

### Please note: The main goal of building this project is to sharpen my skills in python by applying the concepts that I learn.
